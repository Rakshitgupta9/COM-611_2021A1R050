# Candidate Elimination Algorithm for Hypothesis Learning

## Overview
This Python script implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm to learn hypotheses consistent with a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file. The algorithm refines both a specific hypothesis (`specific_h`) and a general hypothesis (`general_h`) based on positive and negative examples in the training data.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and CSV file reading

## Usage
1. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

2. Replace the file path in `data.csv` with the path to your own CSV file containing the training data.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## Code Explanation

- **Step 1:** Read the training data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Step 2:** Extract the feature vectors (`concepts`) and target values (`target`) from the DataFrame.
- **Step 3:** Initialize specific and general hypotheses.
- **Step 4:** Iterate through the training examples and update hypotheses based on positive and negative examples.
- **Step 5:** Display the steps of the Candidate Elimination algorithm.
- **Step 6:** Remove redundant hypotheses from the general hypothesis set.
- **Step 7:** Output the final specific and general hypotheses.

## Output
The script prints the steps of the Candidate Elimination algorithm, displaying the evolving specific and general hypotheses at each iteration. Finally, it outputs the specific and general hypotheses after processing all training examples.
